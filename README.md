Ezra's Blog
====

This responsive is for my blog and was inspired by a few Jekyll themes I liked.
- [Flex](http://the-development.github.io/flex/).
- [Lise Savard](http://lisesavard.com/)

Feel free to use this however you like (MIT License).
At some point I may set this repo up as a "theme" but for now it just hosts
the sources for building my blog, content included.
