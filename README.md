Ezra's Blog
====

A responsive Jekyll theme I designed for my blog. Two notable inspirations for this theme were:
- [Flex](http://the-development.github.io/flex/) (Jekyll Theme)
- [Lise Savard](http://lisesavard.com/) (Personal Website)

Feel free to use this however you like (MIT License).
This repository currently hosts my website in progress, but I will produce a more packaged version of the theme when I'm finished.
