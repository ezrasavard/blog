        <p>Welcome to my site!</p>
        <p>At work, I develop software for large scale concurrent systems. In my free time I enjoy lifting weights, studying things, and playing around with various technologies, like <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/>Jekyll</a>, which I learned to make this website.</p>
        <p>On this site, you'll find a growing pile of information about my undergraduate research, a bit about hobby projects and some random odds and ends. Happy browsing.</p>
