<article>
    
    <p>Welcome to my site!</p>
    <p>In my professional time, I develop embedded software for precision actuators with the Firmware and Electrical Engineering team at <a href=http://www.zaber.com/>Zaber Technologies</a> in Vancouver.</p>
    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending my lifting weights and playing around with various technologies, like <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/>Jekyll</a>, which I learned to make this website.</p>
    <p>This site is pretty spartan as far as content goes. That may change in the future, depending on whether or not I decide to write about more of the things I do.</p>
