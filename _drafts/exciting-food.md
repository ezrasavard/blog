# The Next Agricultural Revolution

Yup, genetic engineering of yeasts to produce other foods. It looks like
we're moving toward programmable farming, and I am really excited.

I don't know quite how to got to Impossible Foods, but I like where this is
going. If we can genetically engineer yeasts to produce other molecules,
then the cost of those molecules drops to the cost of the yeast plus the
cost of the process, which has the potential to displace much more expensive
processes for producing certain molecules, like growing cows.

Because I'm on my way to San Francisco right now for onboarding at Stripe,
I'm going to increment my own stereotype counter and find a fancy restaurant
where I can get some yeast-manufactured fake meat for dinner!

Here is a nice report of the projected economic impacts from these new
fermentation methods: LINK

The fallout is going to be enormous and I'm expecting winners and losers
on the same scale as the introduction of the car. Entire classes of
employment will be wiped out, natural resource utilization will shift,
and one of the last remaining reasons for people to leave in rural areas
will disappear. I am worried about this.
