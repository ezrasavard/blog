As I've grown less arrogant with age, I've come around to the idea that
I can't fully control myself, and moreover that it is a waste effort to try
and do so. Maybe I'd feel differently if signaling that I am the paragon
of self-discipline actually benefitted me, rather than making me look like
a teenager that has just encountered his first Nietzche quote.

A popular narrative of self-control is promoted by Jordan Peterson-esque
self-help types. They talk about taking responsibility,
being disciplined, and that being good at life is the result of
overcoming these obstacles and controlling yourself perfectly in real-time.
I think of this as "active" self-control. With active self-control,
I feel like a total badass for not eating
free cake, and I think that is why it is so seductive. Using this method,
I feel empowered and in-charge of my own destiny.
While I like this sentiment in general, it not necessarily _effective_
for achieving goals.

My preferred alternative is passive control, which is mostly about
avoiding real-time decision making.
When I want to eat free cake, the same delicious, cake-y forces are acting on
the part of me that wants to lose weight.
Passive self-control works by making the best decision the easiest one.

## Environmental Pressures and Mental Fatigue

I find cardio super boring, but really want to improve my heart and
lung health. To this end, I decided to do 45 minutes of cardio,
three times per week.

I find that I spend the entire time trying to convince myself not to stop.
I put on podcasts, I watch a clock and tell myself stories like
"that's 1/4 of the way there, only have to do that three more times,"
but inevitably I get bored and leave, usually in under 15 minutes.
As I run out of mental stamina, the decision to stop becomes easier and easier.

In order to address the mental fatigue problem, I started doing cardio classes
instead. With this strategy, I only have to get myself to the gym and into
the class. Once I am there, the social environment makes it easier to stay for
the entire class than to give up early.

It costs me $50/month thanks to an employer subsidy and I consider that a steal.
If gym class costs were prohibitive, I would have to substitute
with community-sourced forms of social pressure instead
e.g. running groups or team sports.


## Incentive Alignment and Failure Modes

Systems will (mostly) come into line with their environmental incentives, but
that also holds true when they've been designed badly.
One recent example is in the 2018 California wildfires, where the state chose
to pay cleanup crews by weight for removal of debris.
Unsurprisingly, debris removal crews removed a lot of material from every
site they visited. One man returned to find a large hole where his home had
been, since the cleanup crews had opted to remove
several meters of nice, heavy dirt beneath the burned out structure.

A lot of (bad) savings advice follows this general pattern:

<blockquote>
If you go to Starbucks for a fancy latte every day, you are spending $5
per day on a luxury good. That adds up to $1460 per year! Stop buying coffee
and you'll build up your savings in no-time!
</blockquote>

Let's take it as a toy example.

The incentives is to resist buying a coffee and feel good.
This translates into exposing ourselves to
temptation as often as possible, because only then can we resist buying
the coffee (and getting some of that sweet moral superiority).
We will have some pretty heavy mental fatigue, and the failure mode is to
buy a latte and thus not save any money. =\

Buying a latte is not a hard choice in this model. We know that we can
continue to save money tomorrow, the latte is delicious, we are tired, etc.
The immediate benefit calculus pits the latte against a hit of moral
superiority.

The other problem is that even working perfectly,
this won't necessarily result in having any money in savings.

A better system would be to set up an automatic transfer for $75 to our
savings account to occur the day after every payday,
and then not care whether or not we buy lattes.
The decision only has to be made once, it results in saving $1460 per year,
and takes effort to undo. The best decision becomes to do nothing (very easy),
and we can just forget that the system exists.

Funnily enough, my motivation for writing this post was that I did forget
that my savings system existed.
I was feeling bad recently because I haven't actively
invested any money into my retirement savings in a few months. 
This is because I have roughly 25% of my salary invested through various
automatic channels, but since I don't see them, I tend to forget they exist.
I should have set out to create this system myself, but instead
my employer incentivized me to do it through stock discounts and a savings
matching program.


## Good Enough and Measuring Results

It is internet-law that any self-help blog post must mention
pareto-optimality, so here we are. It isn't always required for a system
to be perfect, and most of the time, it takes much, much less effort
to create a "good enough" system. A good example for this is dieting.

Creating a passive control system for weight loss is really hard. To be
perfectly effective, you could remove all food from your home, sign up for
one of those specify-your-calories food delivery services, and then go about
your business without ever going anywhere. Preferably keeping busy.
A system like that is both very hard to implement and very expensive.

A slightly worse but drastically cheaper solution is to stock your home
with foods that are hard to eat lots of calories from, and create a mental
note to avoid eating out often. Add in using a commute method that requires
a good amount of walking, and something starts to take shape.  
If eating out for lunch is your best option, make it a routine to go somewhere
further away that serves lower calorie filling food. Habit is useful
for avoiding real-time decision making. If I choose between burgers and
salads daily, I will sometimes get burgers. If I get lunch nowhere near a
burger joint, I will not get burgers. Make it easy.

If you are trying to gain weight, reverse all that!

Aside from avoiding real-time decision making, the other
important piece of a "good enough" system is having a measurement of
how well it is working.

I have, for the last four years, tracked my food daily
and it was very effective for losing weight quickly,
but it was also a lot of work.
I recently stopped tracking my food, and instead am using daily
body-weight measurements to determine whether I am gaining or losing weight.
This is a much looser control system, since anything less than a month's
data is pretty much worthless to draw conclusions from, but it is good enough.
If I'm not losing weight, I can go back and add more walking
to my commute.


## Conclusions

When trying to achieve any type of goal, consider yourself fallible and
design accordingly!

1. Reward the actual outcome you want
2. Automate it if possible
3. Create or find an environment that incentivizes your goal for you

It is also interesting in retrospect how both of my examples of good
incentive design have come from my employer.
I feel that I underappreciated the power of a well designed benefits
package to basically eliminate two serious problems from my life:
general fitness and financial health.

Lastly, because active control makes me feel like a badass, and I value
feeling like a badass, I should continue to use it for a system that
doesn't have particularly important outcomes. =)
