# On Cost Disease

I've read some great pieces on "cost disease," the notion that everything,
particularly healthcare and education, are getting more expensive for
no good reason. I bought it for a while, but now I've changed my mind.

Because the US healthcare system is such a mess, and most other wealthy
western nations have something more nationalized, I'm going to focus on
universities.

I'll go through the various narratives I've heard and then share my own
point of view, which is that we're seeing spending into extreme
diminishing returns for reasons that are totally understandable.

## The Bloat Narrative

The idea that things are getting more expensive because we aren't
trimming the fat, that self-interested individuals (isn't that everyone?),
are filling up pointless administrative positions, inflating beaurocracy
and driving up prices to support paying their own salaries and benefits.

The symptoms hold up, but I argue the idea that these things are pointless.

There is also data that the administrative share of salary spending in
universities is not actually rising *much*. That surprised me, for reasons
I'll explain later.

The strawman this narrative attacks is the university administrative office
that seemingly has no purpose beyond introducing a parasitic friction
between two other departments.

A fairer narrative for the maligned department is that universities are
growing, and scaling poorly. I prefer this attitude because it doesn't require
anyone to be evil. Unfortunately for it, the scaling argument doesn't really
hold up well, because the administrative share and professorial share
of the universities is not changing much, it implies that universities
scale pretty well.

Another common charicature in the bloat narrative is in healthcare, where
staffing and spending all go to appeasing draconian insurance overlords
and avoiding liability. This charicature is used for universities as well,
usually along with descriptions of snowflake students requiring careful
care and feeding to avoid experiencing the trauma of hearing an idea
they don't agree with.

I think there is some truth to the bloat narrative, but as the data shows,
the administrative share of spending is only increasing a little. If we
consider how massive university spending is, how much land they have,
construction of buildings, etc., it makes sense that salaries
would be a small piece of the puzzle, and new administrative salaries
even smaller. Similar thinking applies to hospitals.


## The Baumol Narrative

This argument is put forth by Alex Tabarrok, who I really like, but disagree
with on this point. It is counter-argued by Scott Alexander, who I also
really like, and agree with more on this one.

The Baumol effect is, in a nutshell, a need to raise salaries in order
to prevent an employee from substituting their current career with a
better paying one. Consider the concert pianist and the machinist
specialized in producing wakallixes, they have the same starting salary.
Imagine that wakallix production technology improves rapidly,
and the machinist captures some of these gains in increased wages. 
The Baumol effect is that the wages of the concert pianist would rise in
order to retain them (or encourage new concert pianists) as the alternatives
get better.

I don't argue that the Baumol effect exists, but I don't think it is
largely responsible for cost disease. I think the Baumol narrative
is mostly knocked out by data on doctors' salaries mostly not increasing
much in the current era, along with labor still being a small
portion of total costs.


## The Conflict Theorists

Typical Marxist viewpoints about people taking power from each-other, etc.
In this case, it is "systems" screwing "people." I never know what to say
about the conflict theories because I just think they make no sense.
I should write something better than that though.

If I replace the concepts of individuals being malicious with incentives
being misaligned (thus conflict), I can roll with it.
There is the occasional "evil capitalist" like EpiPen bro.

Rising costs in this narrative is driven by the money-grabbing people
with power and money ruling over everyone. For every institution, there
is a Koch or a Schrelli screwing over the world with expert manipulations.
Why don't I buy it? First off, it assumes way too much competence. Secondly,
they should be way richer if this were true.

I really need to flesh this whole section out and make it make more sense.


## My Take - No Cost Disease, Just Large Marginal Costs

No matter how good things get, we always want to be healthier, live longer,
and give greater advantages to our children. So if we become wealthier,
doesn't it make sense that we'd want more health, longevity, and advantages
for our children more than we'd want more other stuff? So, we spend
into extreme diminishing returns in these sectors.

For healthcare, we get very little benefit from each additional dollar we
spend beyond the quality of care from the 1950s in most areas, but that
is still worth it to us.

For education, the competitive dynamic leads to universities offering
ever expanding reams of services to boost the value of attending their
institution. The competition also introduces a Red Queen effect, by where
formerly competitive educations are no longer competitive.

## Now What?

So if there is no cost disease to overcome, what should we be doing
to improve life for humanity?

Well, the first thing is that "no cost disease" doesn't mean "no problem."
Essentially, the cost of education is going to continue to increase to
match whatever people can pay for it. It will improve at the same time,
but the marginal value sucks. The competitive dynamic insures that there
will never be slack in the system.

My perspective is that the primary metric for success should be the
quality of life of the poorest X% of all people, and think that focusing
on inequality is both (1) not helpful, and (2) going to lead us toward more
populism. I haven't yet squared this with my experience of my own psychology,
where I cannot avoid relative measurement, so I think there is *something* to
be said for trying to prevent runaway inequality, but not as much as seems
popular right now.

For healthcare, I'd like to see markets work better. I think that would
introduce the usual goodness of lower prices and higher quality, but I
expect that the top-end will continue to grow.

For education, I have no idea how to solve this, and don't even know if it
needs solving. Will education just become a larger part of our lives, a
larger segment of the economy, etc. as we try to get a leg up for ourselves
and our children? Maybe. What are the alternatives?
