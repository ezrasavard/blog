Part 3 - Ethics!
Holy shit, how did we get here?

## Utilitarianism is Optimal Caching
In computing, there is the concept of a cache, where you can go to look
up a value at lower cost than normal. These are space-limited and so
we have many strategies for deciding what goes in the cache and how long
it stays there. The optimal caching strategy, mathematically speaking,
is to cache all the things you will ever need to look up. Unfortunately,
since we are not omniscient, we don't actually know what will need to be
looked up in the future. So even though this strategy is optimal for caching,
it is also completely useless because it is not actionable.

Utilitarianism is an ethical framework that I'll flimsily define as
"looking at the possible outcomes and choosing the path with the best one."
Great! So utilitarianism is optimal caching, but for ethics: useful for the
omniscient. I used to think of myself as a utilitarian, but like other things,
I changed my mind as I became less arrogant. Now a'days I consider myself more 
alined with virtue ethics.
