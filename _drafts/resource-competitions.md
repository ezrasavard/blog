title: Resource Competitions
---

Follow-up to [What is Money?](link).

* Money favors the rich
* Queuing favors those with more available time
* Lottery favors those who tolerate uncertainty
* Nepotism favors the connected
* Violence favors... the effectively violent?

Considerations for any resource allocation competition:
* The system must not break down
* Nobody should be resource starved
* Priority should go to those who want / need the resource most
* The signal of need should be _a good signal_ (expensive to fake)



Is this the right model? This is about competition for resources, and
the different ways that different people compete. Cost and competition
are not exactly the same thing. I shoudl re-write with wording that is more
about competition.

## Examples
### Toll Roads
The somewhat recent trials of [highway name]() in the Washington, DC region is a great example for this.

resource: getting somewhere
money: the toll
queuing: travel time
nepotism: none
violence: none

The resource being allocated is getting somewhere.
The primary ways of paying for it are money and time (queuing).

The system was originally designed to use a flexible money price, and
keep the time-cost roughly fixed. The slower the road gets, the higher the
price becomes until the road is fast again.

This a great system if you value your time much more highly than the
quantities of money involved (prefect economic efficiency!).
This is a terrible system if you value the money more highly than the time
(a highly only for the rich!).

Because both types of people exist, there was outrage from the latter and the
system design was changed so that the price would cap out at $PRICE and
everyone would start queuing again.

Uber surge-pricing is a very similar system, with similar complaints.

### Housing Costs (Rent)
Competition for rental housing in Vancouver is very intense.
People show up at viewings ready to sign checks and submit to arbitrarily
invasive (often illegal) levels of scrutiny. If landlords could price their
units high enough, a small enough pool of applicants would remain, and this
wouldn't happen. This would again favor those who prefer to pay with money,
and price everyone else out.

At a lower price-point, nepotism, and discrimination reign. There are no
good public waitlists or lotteries for ordinary rental housing because that
isn't run by a central authority. Though queuing does come into play
through the large number of units one has to visit.

When a private landlord has too many applicants and money doesn't
differentiate them, they fall back on other signals to identify the most
desirable tenant.

In public housing (or university housing), queuing and lottery systems are
the norm. I waited a full year to get access to on-campus housing at my
university, as the rent was significantly below market.

### Disaster Response
After a disaster is a great (...) time to see this all in action
because many resources suddenly become scarce.

Prices for limited goods skyrocket, people wait endlessly for aid,
communities pull together (not all nepotism is universally frowned upon),
and even looting occurs.

### Healthcare


### Government Jobs
The jobs themselves are insufficiently selective, so nepotism kicks in to
narrow the pool. This would be more of a problem if government jobs
were extremely desirable and high status, but that isn't really the case
in Canada.

## Conclusions
We see these different mechanisms all the time, used in varying proportions.
Often they are mixed in ways that keep all participants happy enough to avoid
violence. Other times, constraints on the use of one method result in
other methods becoming important.
