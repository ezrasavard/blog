# Employment Attitudes

I've had the opportunity to speak with most of my friends about work,
job hunts, and career development in the last few weeks, as a result of a
social blitz I did before moving out of Vancouver. One theme I noticed
was that many of my friends and co-workers expressed very different attitudes
toward the idea of employment than the ones I hold.

To me, the bulk of my employment social contract is that I agree to make
the company's mission my goal for the bulk of my time, and to defer to
company leadership if push comes to shove.

I think this makes me well suited to working in smaller companies and less
so to working in larger ones.

For example, working at Microsoft,
almost any non-malicious action toward our users is acting on the company
mission ("to empower every person and organization on the planet to achieve
more"). Instead in this case I have to choose a lower-level goal post,
like aligning with the mission of my broader team. This could work,
but the mission of the team is actually "to please their overlord," and
the stated goals that will accomplish are both too specific and change too
frequently. This can mean that my employer unilaterally violates our agreement,
in so far as I like to interpret it. Sadness ensues.

## History

When I used to work in food service and retail, work largely fell into three
categories: daily work, work that might make my future work easier, and
tasks that made my employer feel like they were getting their money's worth.

Type 1 work was never really a source of conflict, unless a job was
particularly unpleasant and people felt it wasn't distributed fairly.

Type 2 work was more rare, and somewhat contentious, since it more
obviously benefitted the employee than the employer. An example of this
would be figuring out a better layout for the bar. Most employers
I had in this era were not interested in improving their business or
having employees operate more efficiently. The idea that they could have
a higher throughput cafe never seemed to cross their minds.

Type 3 work though, was almost always contentious and sometimes wandered
into harassment. As a spoiled software engineer, I now fight back
immediately if I detect a hint of type 3 work. I have only
ever encountered type 3 work in this industry
from the most completely inexperienced manager
I worked with, and he stopped after a single conversation about it.

## Attitudes

When we go into employment, we are selling something, and there are many
ways to think about it.

- Selling my alignment
- Selling my skills
- Selling my autonomy
- Selling my time

### Alignment

This is how I view work. I've agreed to make your problem my problem,
but that's most of the contract. I'll also defer to the employer if push
comes to shove on how we should approach the problem, because they have
more skin in the game than I do.

An employer is hiring a limited partner.

There is no concept of working overtime, but I am responsible for sustaining
my own efforts, including taking sufficient time off or pushing hard when
I feel it matters. There is no fear of reprimand.

### Skills

This is how most people I know view work.
They agree to use their skills to perform the tasks that the employer wants
done.

The employer is hiring a skilled.

There appears to be a limited concept of overtime being bad, but sometimes
required. There is fear of reprimand.

### Autonomy
