For this post, I've added a sidebar to the site. The sidebar is mosty pulled from
[Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/sidebar/), and is built with a
flexbox. Historical photo after the break.

<img
    alt="Home page using minimal sidebar"
    src="{{ site.baseurl }}/media/css-sidebar.png"
    title="Image of website at the time of writing, just added the sidebar"
/>

I also added an [RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml). ;)

A big thanks here to Heydon Pickering & Andy Bell at [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/)
for publishing so much of this content free to use. It is great for learning.
