I decided to tear out my convoluted CSS and div-soup website in favour of focusing on the basics: semantic HTML5
and CSS that actually cascades, instead of specifying classes for everything and styling them individually...

<img
    alt="website with no CSS"
    src="{{site.baseurl}}/media/no-css.png"
    title="image of website at the time of writing"
/>

For now, I'm putting it up as a work-in-progress. ;)
