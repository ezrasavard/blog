title: Quantum Monte Carlo - Version 2.0 and Animations

As a first step in my undergraduate research on simulating physical quantum annealing, I wrote some Monte Carlo solver. I wrote my first implementation of a path-integral Quantum Monte Carlo (PI-QMC) in Python using numpy linear algebra operations. The code quality was not great though and it was not particularly nice to use. So a few weeks ago, I decided to re-write it as something I would be happy to share with others, so [here it is!](https://www.github.com/ezrasavard/qmc.git)

# Cool Animations

In order to plot things in 2D, I collapsed the configuration space of the problem into sequential integers, from first explored to last. For that reason, the exploration takes place left to right, while occasionally a walker will wander left to re-check a place it has already been. This seemed like the most elegant way of animating an N! dimensional configuration space.

All the animations are available on [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLxBGDIJioO0N6gDffxE6O4cy7KTYmmzu). Or you can generate your own with the scripts provided with my solvers. =)

The time-steps in this animation happen only on move *acceptances*, so instead of things slowing down, you will notice that the schedule parameter countdown text starts to make jumps downward.


# Try Some Solvers!
Aside from [my re-written solvers](https://www.github.com/ezrasavard/qmc.git) on Github, there are very good free solvers out there like [CASINO](https://vallico.net/casinoqmc/what-is-casino/). My solvers are not optimized and are more useful for being readable, as I learned a great deal by writing them and that was what I wanted to share with others. My original research versions are still on Github [in their own branch](https://github.com/ezrasavard/qmc/tree/undergrad), but I don't recommend using them. =)

On top of CASINO and my own code, the [spinglass server](http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/spinglass/) is a great source of sample problem data with solutions.
