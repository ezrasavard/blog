As part of my efforts to learn CSS (instead of fudging through), I've been reading a lot.
One interesting bit I've been reading through is [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/),
which has been really helpful in learning the basics. Their approach heavily emphasizes leveraging
browser layout algorithms and avoiding extreme specificity.

This post's style improvement was to add in harmonic font sizing, based on Every Layout's
[modular scale post](https://every-layout.dev/rudiments/modular-scale/). Here is a photo, for
posterity.

    src="{{site.baseurl}}/media/css-test-modular-scale.png"
    title="image of website at the time of writing"

I also added a basic CSS demo page to make it easy to see what the current CSS looks like, but
I won't be archiving versions of it. The live version can be found here: [CSS test page]({{site.baseurl}}/css-test).
