It's been occurring to me that I don't post on this blog often because I don't
have anything "worthwhile" to say. Most of the time I am thinking pretty
shallow thoughts and sometimes I think bigger, heavier ones. Of course, if
I only post the heavy thoughts, then this site would be ridiculous and
pompous. Eh. Let's change that.
