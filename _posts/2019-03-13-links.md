Here is a short list of things that I've read in the last few weeks that
were interesting/impactful enough to remember them for more than a few days:

[Alex Tabarrok on Buying Coal Mines](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/02/buy-or-rent-coal-the-coasean-climate-change-policy.html)
<br>
One of the more interesting notions on how money could be spent directly to
discourage coal by limiting supply and thus increasing prices.
The crux of the argument is that the right to mine coal is much cheaper
than the coal itself, because coal mining is expensive. As a result, it is
very cheap to buy the right to leave the coal in the ground, relative to
the cost of all the coal, even before prices rise from limiting supply.

[Scott Alexander Reviews Peter Thiel's "Zero-to-One"](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/31/book-review-zero-to-one/)
<br>
When a blog that I've found super influential reviews a book I found super influential.
There are some excellent thoughts here on Thiel's contrarian takes on both
monopolies and efficient markets. To attempt to summarize, Thiel
thinks taht only firms with monopoly profits can afford the luxury of
long-term thinking. On efficient markets, Thiel argues that a belief in
secrets (thinking you know something that most people don't) is fundamental
in discovering new value. That's another way of saying that value is
created by discovering an ineffiency in the market, and doing something
with it. Scott Alexander has some nice skepticism on these fronts.
Secrets are tough to balance: believe that none exist and you will never
take any risks, believe that you know many and you will just be arrogant and
often wrong.

[Facebook vs Twitter: Fake News Spread Differences](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/02/engagement-with-fake-news-on-facebook-is-declining.html)
<br>
Bad news for people who like fake news? TLDR: fake news engagement on Facebook
relative to Twitter has fallen by 60% since 2016. I would love to see some info about how much
money per user-capita each company is spending on combating fake news spread. How
much of this is company effort, how much is network structure, and how much is
network culture? My limited searching didn't find any hints to these questions yet.

[Using a Hololens to Lay Bricks Better](https://www.archdaily.com/908618/this-is-how-a-complex-brick-wall-is-built-using-augmented-reality)
<br>
I think things like this are underrated applications for mixed reality. This shows
a pair of brick layers doing in 6.5 hours a job that they estimated would take
two full weeks, with more accurate results.
This technology is really not very good right now, so it is even more exciting
to see such a viable application.

[Molten Salt Nuclear Reactor Development](https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/technology/2019/nuclear-goes-retro-much-greener-outlook)
<br>
I am not a nuclear engineer, but I'm really optimistic about these molten salt
nuclear reactors as a long-term (next century) energy solution until fusion becomes useful.
The article provides a lot of detail and makes a strong case for this technology.
It also gives some history on how we got to the nuclear reactor technology in use
today, and why the waste products are so bad (short answer: prevent proliferation
of fissile material).

[Giant Airships - Industry Size Estimates](https://www.roadlessrevolution.com/2019/02/why-giant-airships-could-be-trillion.html?m=1)
<br>
Giant airships are super cool, for aesthetic reasons. I also think they bring a
lot of the same benefits as shipping, without being _anchored_ to using
coastal ports, specific canals, etc. They also seem to fit into a currently
unpopulated niche in the speed/cost balance for transporting goods.
This linked post shares a lot of great info, including actual estimates
of the future industry size.

[Status as a Service and Proof of Work in Social Networks](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service)
<br>
Warning: massive read (took me over 2 hours of actual reading time).
Eugene Wei provides a great deep-dive on social networks and their various
mechanisms for providing social status and utility, including some fun
comparisons to ICOs by discussing proof of work via wit, or dancing.

[Tim Sweeney is Building the Metaverse via Fortnite?](https://redef.com/original/fortnite-is-the-future-but-probably-not-for-the-reasons-you-think)
<br>
I've never played Fortnite, but after spending countless hours standing around
Dalaran (World of Warcraft) chatting with people and jumping back and forth
over a fountain, I get the appeal of having
3D avatars in your chat room. What I find interesting here is:

1. Doing it across so many platforms
2. Doing it with a userbase that is not just MMORPG players
3. Pulling in traditionally non-virtual forms of group entertainment like the
much talked about _Marshmellow_ concert

I wonder how they plan to reach the point where users create content without
running into the ["sea of dicks" problem, e.g. Second Life (not quite NSFW)](http://digg.com/2018/second-life-in-2018).

[Scott Alexander Makes Conspiracy Theory Posters for Real Things](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/04/prospiracy-theories/)
<br>
Basically, he tries to use the language/style of conspiracy theorists on
the ordinary beliefs they often want to debunk. Some of this stuff got me
to actually "lol" in public in a non-idiomatic but literal way.
There are some gems in the comments too, like [this one arguing that Israel
might actually be run by Jews](https://imgur.com/gallery/pWyXCZl).
