As I've grown less arrogant with age, I've come around to the idea that
I can't fully control myself, and moreover that it is a waste effort to try
and do so. Maybe I'd feel differently if signaling that I am the paragon
of self-discipline actually benefitted me, rather than making me look like
a teenager that has just encountered his first Nietzche quote.

A popular narrative of self-control, promoted by Jordan Peterson-esque
self-help types, emphasizes taking responsibility,
being disciplined. It summizes that being good at life is the result of
overcoming these obstacles and controlling yourself perfectly in real-time.
In this model, I feel like a total badass for not eating some
free cake.
I feel empowered and in-charge of my own destiny, and that is why it is so
seductive. I used to approach life this way, but
I no longer think that it is _effective_ for achieving goals.

I now prefer to think in terms of
strategies that help me succeed most of the time. Usually it comes down to
avoiding real-time decision making, because when I want to eat free cake,
the same delicious, cake-y forces are acting on
the part of me that wants to lose weight.
A good system results in achieving my goals by default.

## Boring Cardio

I find cardio super boring, but really want to improve my heart and
lung health to improve my odds of living a long and healthy life.
To this end, I decided to do 45 minutes of cardio three times per week.

I found that I spent the entire time trying to convince myself not to
quit early. I would distract myself with podcasts (partially works)
and then watch the clock and treat fractions of completion as milestones
worth pushing for.
Inevitably I get bored and leave, usually in under 15 minutes, because
the decision to stop early becomes easier and easier the longer this goes on.

In order to address the mental fatigue problem, I started doing cardio classes
at a local gym instead. I put the class in my calendar for M/W/F and
now I just go when my notification pops up.
Once I am there, the social environment makes it easier to stay for
the entire class than to give up early. I go into a room and do whatever
this person tells me to for an hour, and I get my workout.

It costs me $50/month thanks to an employer subsidy and I consider that a steal.
If gym class costs were prohibitive, I would have to substitute
with community-sourced forms of social pressure instead
e.g. running groups or team sports, and that would take more effort.

The success of this system is that I use the bare minimum real-time
decision making to put myself into an environment where I would have to
make a significant effort to _avoid_ achieving my goal.


## Retirement Savings

A lot of (bad) savings advice follows this general pattern:

<blockquote>
If you go to Starbucks for a fancy latte every day, you are spending $5
per day on a luxury good. That adds up to $1460 per year! Stop buying coffee
and you'll build up your savings in no-time!
</blockquote>

This is a terrible system.
First off, it creates an incentive to expose ourselves to the temptation
of buying coffees just so we can resist buying them.
Further, buying a latte anyway is not a hard decision to arrive at:
we know that we can continue to save money tomorrow,
the latte is delicious, we are tired, etc.
The immediate benefit calculus pits the goodness of the latte against a
hit of moral superiority.

I used to do this, and at the end of the month, I'd throw whatever
balance-above-a-threshold I had in the bank into my savings. Aside from
taking a lot of effort, it wasn't super effective at actually putting
money aside because that was never measured.
I did however spend a lot of time agonizing over whether or not to buy coffees,
and then feeling crappy when I did.
A much better system would (1) avoid real-time decision making, and (2)
actually result in putting money away.

So with the goal of saving $1460 per year, we could set up an automatic
transfer for $75 to our savings account to occur the day after every payday.
We only have to make the decision once (in a good state of mind)
and it results in saving the required amount of money annually.
Better still, it takes effort to screw it up (dismantling the system)
and works independently of whether or not I am buying lattes.

Funnily enough, my motivation for writing this post was that I did forget
that my savings system existed, and then felt bad about not investing more.
That in-turn got me thinking about how the self-control narratives
I enjoy are actually counterproductive to achieving my goals.
At present, I have 25% of my salary invested through various
automatic channels, but I don't see the process.
I should have set out to create this system myself, but instead
my employer incentivized me to do it through stock discounts and a savings
matching program. Thanks HR! If enrollment were automatic, this would be
even better.


## Losing Weight

I've gone through periods of deliberate weight-loss a few times in my life,
once late in my teenage years when I began living on my own, another
after recovering from a spinal injury, another after leaving a really
depressing job, and most recently after a bit of over-zealous bulking.

Dieting is pretty hard in general because it pits our self-control against
some of the more basic elements of our behavior, and progress only shows
in the long term. We start every day at zero, and keep (enjoyably)
adding calories until the point where we need to stop. If we reach that
point too early in the day, it is going to be very hard to not eat any more.
Even worse, our mental stamina is reduced by the deficit we are trying to
create.

How do we make a system where we don't have to think about our food,
and where the easiest option is to have a caloric deficit?

A perfect passive system for weight loss would involve never making a
decision about what or when to eat, and keeping busy enough to not notice.
One could completely clear their home of all food, sign up for a
weight loss oriented meal delivery service, and then not take any money
when going out of the house, but that is a really, really, expensive
and invasive option.
Lastly, something would have to be done in order to enforce caloric expenditure.

Internet-law demands that any self-help blog post must mention
pareto-optimality, so here we are. It isn't always required for a system
to be perfect, and most of the time, it takes much, much less effort
to create a "good enough" system.
What I'm doing now is good enough and very easy to maintain.

At home, I keep a lot of rice cakes, diet pop, and gum lying around. I
mostly cook eggs and vegetables, and also eat toast.
Crucially, I don't have any hyper-palatable snacks or sweets in my house.
It isn't that I don't eat sweets,
but that I want it to require a lot of effort to acquire them
so that I don't do it often.

The closest thing that I've found to an automatic bank transfer for creating
a caloric deficit is to skip breakfast and walk a lot as part of my commute.
I also double-dip on my gym classes here by going to them at noon.
Locking myself in a room for an hour helps me delay eating, and then cardio
is a good appetite suppressent, so I tend to get lunch around 2pm.
The caloric expenditure is gravy.

Eating at work can be a bit harder.
Recently, I decided to end my long-time habit of bulk cooking my week's
lunches every weekend and switch to eating out, since the cost is not
that different, and it frees up a lot of time
(weight loss is not my main priority). One of the challenges
has been the frequent exposure to lots of high calorie options that
are really tasty, so I sometimes end up choosing them.
So far, I'm managing this by going to places where
(1) my favorite dishes are low cal and filling,
(2) I have to walk 2km or more to get to,
and (3) that are not located next to a higher cal place I might prefer.

I'm still eating dinner out more often than I'd like to, and I haven't
figured out a good way to disincentivize that yet. Email me if you have
any ideas!

Aside from creating an environment conducive to weight loss, I
also avoid environments where it is easy to
overeat. This means that I try to skip events that offer free
food, since I almost always overeat in those situations, and prefer to
meet my friends for coffee rather than meals.

I used to track all of my food daily, as well as
my weight, and that was useful for losing weight on a set schedule.
With that approach, I could lose 1lb/week reliably over several months.
For long-term passive weight management though,
I don't think intake tracking is the right approach.
For the last two months, I only track my body weight.
I weigh myself every day at the same time and record it, and then
use a one month trendline to see how things are going (anything less than a
month is dominated by water-weight fluctuations).
So far, I'm losing about 1.5lbs/month on this system, which is slower
than I'd like, but very, very easy to keep up.

One confounder here is that my years of food intake tracking mean that
I am pretty accurate in estimating how many calories I'm eating.
I occasionally track everything just to check and I'm usually +/- 100 kcal
for the day.
I also mostly trust restaurant nutrition facts, but add 20%
if the portions are set by a human server.


## Conclusions

Whenever I want to achieve something, I consider myself failure-prone and
design accordingly:

1. Minimize opportunities to deviate from the goal
2. Create or find an environment that makes achieving the goal the easiest choice
3. Measure the actual desired outcome variable

This mostly seems to be working.

It is also interesting in retrospect how implicated my employer is in
all of these systems. Most directly, in the savings case,
they directly incentivized and designed the system I use.
In other cases, fitness subsidies and flexible work schedules still play a
pretty big role. Market rate for my fitness classes would, at a minimum,
be roughly 6x the price I pay.
I feel that I have underappreciated the power of a well designed benefits
package to both incentivize good behaviors and also enable them.
Given that I worked for a decade without such things, I'm surprised I
didn't notice it sooner.
