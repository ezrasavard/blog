In my life, I've mostly approached
achieving my goals via rigid self-discipline. I've viewed any mis-steps
as a sign of weaknesses to be overcome through willpower.
This approach emphasizes confronting obstacles head-on and feeling morally
superior for overcoming them.

A present-day evangelist of this attitude would be Jordan B. Peterson. I think
his message of self-reliance and confronting our own weakness
appeals strongly to young men who want to prove themselves
in the world, as it did to me. I'm not exactly sure how I was introduced to
it, but heroically rising up against obstacles and triumphing by sheer force
of will is not exactly a rare message in fiction consumed by young boys.

Using this model, I felt like a total badass each time I chose not to eat
some free cake. It follows the same narrative as my childhood heroes.
I felt empowered and in-charge of my own destiny, and that is why it was so
seductive. I now I see this approach as a way to _feel like_ I am making
progress, but not a good way to actually achieve my goals.

As I've grown less arrogant with age, I've come around to the idea that
I can't fully control myself, and moreover that it is a waste effort to try.
I now prefer to think in terms of
strategies that help me succeed most of the time, without constant effort.
Usually this comes down to avoiding real-time decision making.

A good system results in achieving my goals by either doing nothing
or doing whatever is easiest in the moment.
The challenge is to create an environment so that I, through normal
day-to-day activities, will progress toward my goals at an acceptable pace.

## Retirement Savings and Coffee

I moved out of my family home and started working full-time around age 20
and reached a point of financial self-sufficiency near the end of my
degree, ten years later. In the time between,
I spent many years living paycheck-to-paycheck,
with a bit of help from my family, as many young people do.
I wanted to try and save money where I could, and one place I spent money
luxuriously was on buying coffee at work. Avocado toast was not yet in vogue.

A lot of (bad) savings advice follows this general pattern:

<blockquote>
If you go to Starbucks for a coffee every day, you are wasting $3
every single day. That adds up to $1095 per year! Stop buying coffee
and you'll build up your savings in no-time!
</blockquote>

This is a terrible system! A much better one is to put aside money
every payday, before having any opportunity to spend it,
but that isn't what I did. What I did was to view
drinking coffee as a kind of weakness that needed to be overcome.
Feeling like the way forward is to overcome weakness means that
I was incentivized to confront my weakness, so that I could overcome it.

As a result, this scene was often played out:
I stood in the line at Starbucks waiting to buy a coffee during my break
while agonizing over whether or not I should go to the water fountain instead.
The result would either be (1) coffee and feeling like a fatally flawed
human being, or (2) feelings of moral superiority and
a headache due to my unsatisfied caffeine addiction.

In this environment, buying a coffee is a really easy decision to make:
I knew that I could continue to save money the next day,
the coffee is delicious, I was usually tired and probably had a headache, etc.
The immediate benefit calculus pit the goodness of the coffee against the
hit of moral superiority from overcoming my own weakness. The actual financial
savings barely figured.

At the end of the month, I'd throw whatever balance-above-a-threshold I had
into my savings, which was normally zero dollars.
This system took a lot of effort, and was not effective at actually putting
money aside because that was never measured.
I did however spend a lot of time agonizing over whether or not to buy coffees,
and then feeling crappy either way.

So with the goal of saving $1095 per year, I could instead have set up an
automatic transfer of $46 to my savings account to occur every payday.
This is a good system because I only have to make the decision once
(in a good state of mind) and it results in saving the required amount of
money annually with no additional action.
Better still, it takes effort to screw it up (dismantling the system).

Another way to view it is that we trust our day-to-day selves to effectively 
manage finances over a short period of time, but not over several years.
Building a system like this puts access to resources in order of priorities,
so the main impact of daily coffee buying would be a reduction in
buying something else that day, e.g. dinner out. I would still manage to
balance my monthly finances, but long-term goals would go as planned.

Funnily enough, my motivation for writing this post was that I actually forgot
that my savings system existed recently, and was feeling bad about not
saving more. That in-turn got me thinking about how the self-control
narratives I enjoy are actually counterproductive to achieving my goals.
At present, I have a chunk of my salary invested through various
automatic channels, but I don't see the process.

It is common advice to create automatic savings systems, and
despite knowing that, I still didn't create one myself. Thankfully,
my employer did it for me, and got me to participate through stock discounts
and a savings matching program. 

I feel that I have undervalued the power of a well designed
benefits package to both incentivize good behaviors and also enable them.
Given that I worked for a decade without such things, I'm surprised I
didn't notice it sooner. While I don't think I could have saved a large
percentage of my salary when I worked for minimum wage,
I think I could have managed $1095 per year this way,
and that would have been a lot more than I saved by
agonizing in the line at Starbucks.


## Learnings

After a lot of thinking on this topic, the most important take-away
for me was to consider the process of achieving a goal to be more
a matter of designing the correct environment and less about
overcoming personal weakness.

1. Minimize opportunities to deviate from the goal
2. Create or find an environment that makes achieving the goal the easiest choice
3. Measure the actual desired outcome variable

I'm trying to apply similar thinking now to improving my cardio fitness
(which is very boring) and losing weight with lower effort.
This mostly seems to be working.
