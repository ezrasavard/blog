I probably read this while link hopping from [Tyler Cowen's blog](https://marginalrevolution.com/about)
but I can no longer find a source. It was something like:

> Money is one of many systems for allocating resources. Others include queuing, and violence.

This idea has really stuck with me and changed how I think about things like
toll roads, housing costs, and disaster response. Also a lot about the ideas
of efficiency and fairness. Money is most efficient if everyone has the same
amount to spend, and both queuing and lotteries are very fair, but terribly
inefficient because nobody can outbid to signal greater need.

I think we build resource allocation systems to balance our own ideas of
efficiency and fairness.
And when trying to acquire a resource, we prefer whatever mixture that gives us
the best chance of winning. The popular restaurant is a great example to think on.
* Long lines
* High prices
* A reservations system that runs a lottery
* A nepotistic reservations system

What's the best mix to allocate a table? Depends who you ask and what they have to trade.
