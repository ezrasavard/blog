I'm a software engineer living in Vancouver, BC. Other than working, I enjoy weight lifting and reading interesting things, draw from the realms of business, technology, economics, psychology, politics, and education, in no particular order. This site is the home for some of my old undergraduate research, some odds and ends, and thoughts on life.

Enjoy.
