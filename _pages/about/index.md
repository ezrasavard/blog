I'm a software engineer living in Vancouver, BC. Other than working, I enjoy weight lifting and reading interesting things from the set of business, technology, economics, psychology, politics, and education, in no particular order.

This site is the home for some of my thoughts on life, some odds and ends, and my old undergraduate research.

Enjoy!
