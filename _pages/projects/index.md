# Solo Projects

## 1. This website!
I had always been intimidated by web programming, since I had zero formal
instruction in the area. Then again, it's not like I had formal instruction in
scientific computing, C, Python, virtual networking or PCB design, and I've actually been *paid* to do all those things.

This site was built from the ground up using Jekyll and sass to replace my old Wordpress site which was very good at sending me emails about update requests and brute force attacks on the admin page.

I had a great time producing this site was as little code repetition as I could manage. Jekyll was a pleasure to use and being able to place conditional statements inside my DOM was awesome as it allowed me to create fairly flexible layouts.

## 2. Undergraduate research
Okay, maybe it is a bit of a stretch to put this on my personal projects page.
In my fourth year of undergrad, I decided to try and do something that I
considered "really hard," so I signed up for an undergraduate thesis to do
research into simulating quantum annealing computers. I invested myself very
heavily in it, taught myself monte carlo simulation methods and implemented
multiple solvers from scratch. This grew into a full-time funded summer
research position.

## 1. [Sunrise Emulation Headboard Lamp](http://www.lisesavard.com/wakeup/)
I had a lot of fun working on this through two hardware revisions and their
corresponding software rewrites.
