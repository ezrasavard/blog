In the future, these blurbs will lead to full-fledged pages of their own.

## Solo Projects

1. This website!
I had always been intimidated by web programming, since I had zero formal
instruction in the area. Then again, it's not like I had formal instruction in
scientific computing, C, Python, virtual networking or PCB design, and I've
been paid to do all those things.

2. Undergraduate research
Okay, maybe it is a bit of a stretch to put this on my personal projects page.
In my fourth year of undergrad, I decided to try and do something that I
considered "really hard," so I signed up for an undergraduate thesis to do
research into simulating quantum annealing computers. I invested myself very
heavily in it, taught myself monte carlo simulation methods and implemented
multiple solvers from scratch. This grew into a full-time funded summer
research position.

## Collaborations with [Lise](http://www.lisesavard.com)

1. [Sunrise Emulation Headboard Lamp](http://www.lisesavard.com/wakeup/)
I had a lot of fun working on this through two hardware revisions and their
corresponding software rewrites.
